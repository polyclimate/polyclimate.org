<p>It might appear surprising but there exists no complete and regularly updated global emissions dataset which covers the greenhouse gases needed to run a simple climate model or to answer the question what are global emissions levels currently at with confidence. Usually, each time a new combination of source datasets has to be assembled. Depending on approach the values might differ significantly.</p>
<p>IPCC AR6 WGIII reported 59 Gt CO₂-eq in 2019, the <em>Indicators of Global Climate Change 2022</em> paper <span class="citation" data-cites="Forster_2023_gsbsj4">(Forster et al. 2023)</span> used some different data sources and updated landuse data and reported 55 Gt CO₂-eq. The <a href="https://climateactiontracker.org/global/temperatures/">Climate Action Tracker</a> had 52.3 Gt CO₂-eq for 2019 in its November 2022 update.</p>
<p>Some of the differences can be explained by different choice of dataset but the decision which dataset to use sometimes appear arbitrary. In the <em>Indicators of Global Climate Change 2022</em> paper, an update to the data published in the IPCC’s AR6 report, the authors pick different data sources:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>We also use the same type of data sources but make important changes to the specific selection of data sources to further improve the quality of the data, as suggested in the knowledge gap discussion of the WGIII report (Dhakal et al., 2022). Instead of using EDGAR data (which are now available as version 7), we use GCB data for CO2-FFI, PRIMAP-hist data for CH4 and N2O, and atmospheric concentrations with best-estimate lifetimes for UNFCCC F-gas emissions (Hodnebrog et al., 2020). As in AR6 WGIII we use GCB for net CO2-LULUCF emissions, taking the average of three bookkeeping models.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="Forster_2023_gsbsj4">(Forster et al. 2023)</span></p>
<p>They give the reason for their choices as follows:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>There are three reasons for these specific data choices. First, national greenhouse gas emissions inventories tend to use improved, higher-tier methods for estimating emissions fluxes than global inventories such as EDGAR or CEDS (Dhakal et al., 2022; Minx et al., 2021). As GCB and PRIMAP-hist integrate the most recent national inventory submissions to the UNFCCC, selecting these databases makes best use of country-level improvements in data-gathering infrastructures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="Forster_2023_gsbsj4">(Forster et al. 2023)</span></p>
<p>If the suggestion to use more data from national inventories can be inferred from the <em>Knowledge Gaps</em> section in the IPCC WGIII Chapter 2 discussion, why wasn’t it already used in AR6? The data sources used in the IGCC report were available then as well.</p>
<p>Given the number of datasets there are other combinations possible. A recent paper on <em>National contributions to climate change due to historical emissions</em>, with quite some overlap of authors with the IGCC paper, prefers third-party reported data which lie in the middle of other estimates:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>As discussed above, Minx et al.&nbsp;(ref. 64) compared available estimates of CH4 and N2O emissions and found that PRIMAP-hist (TP scenario) lies centrally amongst those estimates. […] Hence, we note that the CH4 and N2O emissions estimates used in the current study lie centrally within a large uncertainty range globally and within a poorly constrained uncertainty range on national scales.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="Jones_2023_gsc84q">(Jones et al. 2023)</span></p>
<p>In any case, more discussion and research is needed, as was discussed in the <a href="https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/15/2295/2023/essd-15-2295-2023-discussion.html#CC11">peer review</a> of the IGCC paper.</p>
<p>Different choices have also been made in previous IPCC reports. AR4 wrote in its chapter on <a href="https://archive.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg3/en/ch1s1-3.html">“Energy, emissions and trends in Research and Development – are we on track?”</a> that</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>[a] variety of sources exist for determining global and regional GHG and other climate forcing agent trends. Each source has its strengths and weaknesses and uncertainties.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For its assessment it appears to have used EDGAR and CDIAC. Then, AR5 used versions of <a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-product/greenhouse-gas-emissions-from-energy">IEA</a> and <a href="https://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/">EDGAR</a> data <span class="citation" data-cites="krey2014annex">(Krey et al. 2014)</span>.</p>
<p>It is hard to disentangle changes over time and to understand differences between studies if different datasets are used every time. The detailed review of CO₂ datasets by <span class="citation" data-cites="andrewComparisonEstimatesGlobal2020">Andrew (2020b)</span> found that differences between datasets to a large part come down to different system boundaries, the inclusion or omission of sources. It also included a call for an Intercomparison Project:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Given the inconsistent system boundaries across emissions datasets, one could conceive of a “carbon emissions dataset intercomparison project”, or CEDIP, along the lines of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) and other related model comparison projects. A core part of these intercomparison projects is the requirement that participants report model outputs to a specified and very clear template such that the issue of system boundary differences is removed. For example, an estimate for global total CO2 emissions could not be reported for a dataset if it excluded sources or countries. In effect, a CEDIP would extend the work done in this article, allowing each data provider to submit according to their superior understanding of their own datasets, permitting more robust comparison, and, critically, allowing lessons to be gained such that estimates can be improved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the reply to Reviewer #1 Robbie Andrew wrote:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Page 40 line 637: Would a recommendation to data producers be to make their methodology and data sources more transparent to allow for better understanding?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The difficulty I have here is what concrete suggestions can be made for doing this. I know that different groups have thought a lot about how to transparently and comprehensively document methods and sources, but still we come up with a lot of missing and obscured information. <strong>I tend to think this is almost unsolvable</strong>. While it might be thought that the best approach might be to have a standard format, the methods differ quite substantially such that it’s not necessarily straightforward to report them in the same way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="Andrew_2020_gsmw4p">(emphasis mine, Andrew 2020a)</span></p>
<p>Getting data providers to agree on a common format is definitely a challenge and releasing or cleaning up data pipelines is not a priority for researchers in the current academic system.</p>
<p>Another issue is the interdependence of datasets, which makes it hard to assess uncertainty from differences between datasets. From the same study the construction and relationships of CO₂ emissions datasets is shown below.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="community-projects">Community projects</h3>
<p>There exist a number of emissions data projects who already have elements of community projects. Even open peer review and working in public can improve the process and signal openness to outside contributors.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://globalcarbonbudget.org/">Global Carbon Budget</a>, an annually published report which is part of the <a href="https://www.globalcarbonproject.org">Global Carbon Project</a> is something to look into when thinking on how to produce datasets from the community <span class="citation" data-cites="friedlingsteinGlobalCarbonBudget2022a">(Friedlingstein et al. 2022)</span>. While there are many co-authors collaborating only a small number is directly working on fossil and land-use emissions, as other area of the Carbon Cycle are also covered in the paper. In any case, the lack of direct funding has been a persistent problem:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The work we do in <a href="https://twitter.com/gcarbonproject/">@gcarbonproject</a> has <em>zero</em> direct funding, we have to align with other project activities to cover costs. Yet, we persist in updating annually.</p>
<p>These seem to be standard issues for anyone working on data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Peters_Glen/status/1446381946913894404">(Glen Peters on Twitter)</a></p>
<p>The Global Carbon Budget is widely used, but covers only CO₂. The <a href="https://primap.org/primap-hist/">PRIMAP-hist</a> dataset covers all Kyoto greenhouse gases <span class="citation" data-cites="gutschowPRIMAPhistNationalHistorical2016b">(Gütschow et al. 2016)</span> but doesn’t include emissions from international aviation and shipping. Emissions from land-use are not included in the main file but only in a separate file and come with a caveat since “they are constructed from different sources using different methodologies and are not harmonized” <span class="citation" data-cites="Guetschow_2023_gsmrpq">(Gütschow and Pflüger 2023)</span>.<br>
In a comment on the <a href="https://polyclimate.org/posts/announcing-project-polyclimate/">announcement post</a> <a href="https://github.com/mikapfl">Mika Pflüger</a> mentioned the potentially collaborative setup for doing the hard work of freeing data submitted to the UN from PDFs and the challenges with storing larger data on GitHub. Code and data can be found in their <a href="https://gin.hemio.de/jguetschow/UNFCCC_non-AnnexI_data">GIN server</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.pnnl.gov/projects/ceds">Community Emissions Data System (CEDS)</a> for Historical Emissions <span class="citation" data-cites="Hoesly_2018_gcxtgm">(Hoesly et al. 2018)</span> covers a different subset of species and is probably the most open of the emission products . The <a href="https://github.com/JGCRI/CEDS/">code on GitHub</a> is available and only some input data from the IEA is missing to make this fully reproducible. However, long-term sustainability has been a question as well from Reviewer #1:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>An outline of long-term plans for the CEDS database is needed in the summary section to build confidence in its sustainability. Modelers would like to know if they can rely on the CEDS system working even after CMIP6. What are the plans for maintenance of the back-end software, frequency of updates to the input data and for maintaining funding for CEDS?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="Anonymous_2017_gsm2zg">(Anonymous 2017)</span></p>
<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191219040122/http://www.match-info.net/">MATCH</a> (Ad-hoc group for the modelling and assessment of contributions to climate change) working group is quite interesting in this context. As part of UNFCCC negotiations Brazil proposed in 1997</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>to set differentiated emissions reduction targets for Parties according to the impact of their historic emissions on temperature rise (document FCCC/AGBM/1997/MISC.1/Add.3).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the expert meetings an open group of voluntary contributors emerged, who published several papers, including assessments of historical emissions, supported by governments who funded travel and administrative support. It could be instructive to learn more from the history of this project (and how to prevent results getting lost when domains aren’t renewed anymore.)</p>
<p>What are the challenges for having an emissions dataset intercomparison project? Have any proposals already be written? How can we get a regularly updated dataset of the inputs required to run a simple climate model? Do we need something like the Global Carbon Project for all greenhouse gases?</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>We have put a lot of effort into understanding the variation in fossil CO₂ emissions, but what about other GHG emissions?</p>
<p>I would say we have some work to do… We need a <a href="https://twitter.com/gcarbonproject">@gcarbonproject</a> covering all GHG emissions! https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/13/5213/2021/</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Peters_Glen/status/1459065929124376577">(Glen Peters on Twitter)</a></p>
<p>An do we have to rely on crowdfunding to get it?</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Yes please. Not having one single authoritative dataset for non-CO2 emissions makes running an emissions-based simple climate model particularly difficult🙃</p>
<p>Will donate $10 to a crowdfunder?</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><img src="https://polyclimate.org/posts/announcing-project-polyclimate/duck.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Cover of Michael Nielsen's book Reinventing Discovery, a tree and three ducks in the background"></p>
<p>It is 100 days until <a href="https://www.cop28.com/en/">COP28</a> in Dubai. The <a href="https://unfccc.int/topics/global-stocktake">Global Stocktake</a>, the process to assess progress towards the goals of the Paris Climate Change Agreement, is scheduled to take place every five years and for the first time during COP28.</p>
<p>Some questions and indicators one might ask about during such a Global Stocktake, or in fact constantly, when thinking about climate change, could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are global emissions levels?</li>
<li>How far are we from 1.5 or 2.0°C?</li>
<li>How big is the remaining carbon budget?</li>
<li>When adding together climate plans of countries (<a href="https://unfccc.int/NDCREG">NDCs</a>), where do we end up?</li>
</ul>
<p>When trying to look up an answer for questions like these, they can be surprisingly difficult to find given their importance for our common future. Of course answers exist, in academic publications, in reports like those from the <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/">IPCC</a>, or in reports or websites from various governmental or non-governmental organizations. Few of them however are regularly updated and fully done reproducibly in the spirit of open science, where the latter would make it easier to achieve the former.</p>
<section id="polyclimate" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="polyclimate">Polyclimate</h3>
<p>The <em>Polyclimate</em> project is a place to think about how questions like the above could be approached using modern tools for collaboration, to discuss what are the barriers that so far prevented such collaboration from happening, and to hopefully kickstart some actual work on producing answers to these questions in a regularly updated, open, and inclusive way.</p>
<p>It is of course named after and inspired by the <a href="https://polymathprojects.org/">Polymath</a> project. In 2009 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Gowers">Timothy Gowers</a> asked in his blog the question:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><a href="https://gowers.wordpress.com/2009/01/27/is-massively-collaborative-mathematics-possible/">“Is massively collaborative mathematics possible?”</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer is of course yes, numerous publications and succesful proofs have emerged from the project and follow-ups. In the post he writes</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I’ve been thinking of doing this for a long time.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So have I on doing this for some questions of climate science and when looking up whether someone had already used “Polyclimate” for this I was happily surprised to find some discussion in this <a href="https://judithcurry.com/2011/04/22/polyclimate/">blog</a>. This went apparently nowhere, and, to be clear, I am not interested in using “collective intelligence” or the “power of the internet” to “move forward on the climate debate”. Nonetheless, there are some interesting observations made, for example <a href="https://michaelnielsen.org/">Michael Nielsen</a> commented on the idea of <em>mass collaboration</em>:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>A crucial question about mass collaboration is when problems can be attacked using mass collaboration, and when it will fail. I believe the key question is whether the community involved in the collaboration has a “shared praxis” or not. By this, I mean a powerful set of shared techniques and agreed-upon methods of reasoning which all participants agree to use.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>For climate change the issue of a shared praxis seems complicated. I think it’s pretty near a dividing line. Reading online discussions of climate, it’s obvious that many people don’t even share the same basic modes of reasoning: what one person counts as “evidence” is ignored by others, basic standards of logic are outright ignored, and so on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t think <em>massive</em> online collaboration is needed, but getting a number of researchers working together, which is larger than the usual teams collaborating on questions like the ones mentioned above could have tremendous benefits. There are many areas where finding the right specialist, for example with knowledge of some specific sector’s emission could be enabled by the internet much more likely than in traditional academic collaboration.</p>
<p>So this <em>Polyclimate</em> project is not about solving the “climate issue”. It is also not about the climate in urban systems which I discovered when searching for “polyclimate”:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Far more attached to the subject than Friedman, Schulze-Fielitz spent 20 years studying the air-conditioning of “urban systems.” His concept of “Polyclimate” went hand in hand with Raumstadt: to each activity its space and its climate. <span class="citation" data-cites="rouillard2018megaspace">(Rouillard 2018)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hope <em>Polyclimate</em> can move forward the way in which researchers work together on some of the grunt work, producing basic data sets and indicators which are crucial for all of climate science but due to various reasons are not done continuously in a fully open, collaborative manner. Certainly, one can learn from the successes in online collaboration in Mathematics.</p>
</section>
<section id="polymath" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="polymath">Polymath</h3>
<p>An article in Nature (unfortunately paywalled, but available online at the <a href="https://www.michaelnielsen.org/papers/mcm.pdf">author’s website</a>) summarizes the Polymath story and lines out ideas for other disciplines:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The ‘Polymath Project’ proved that many minds can work together to solve difficult mathematical problems. <span class="citation" data-cites="Gowers_2009_bv7jtp">(Gowers and Nielsen 2009)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Building up a regularly updated global emissions or temperature dataset is of course quite different from finding a new proof, but there are many insights which can be adapted from the experiences of the Polymath projects.</p>
<p>In his book <em>Reinventing Discovery</em> <a href="https://michaelnielsen.org/">Michael Nielsen</a> argues that scientists are more likely to contribute to projects like Polymath or Galaxy Zoo where the final output is a classical output like a scientific paper compared to projects like GenBank or Wikipedia, where their expertise would be helpful as well but is not as incentivized <span class="citation" data-cites="nielsen2011reinventing">(p.9, Nielsen 2011)</span>. In Polymath, papers were published under the pseudonym D. H. J. Polymath. I believe that publishing under pseudonym or as a working group is a critical component in getting collaborative and repeatedly updated climate science to work.</p>
<p>There are many challenges for any such project and it is quite interesting to go back through the archives of Timothy Gower’s blog for the <a href="https://gowers.wordpress.com/category/polymath/">Polymath category</a>, read about the process, and find for example <a href="https://gowers.wordpress.com/2009/09/16/possible-future-polymath-projects/">discussions on thread depth</a> for the blog:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>On the Polymath blog, a very high level of threading is allowed, with the result that the order of comments is very different from their chronological order. This makes it substantially harder to check what has been added recently than it would be if there were no threading. It’s not impossible, since one has a list of recent comments, but it does reduce the feeling of a polymathematical thought process unfolding over time. I know that there is disagreement about this, but I am going back to the view that there should be no threading at all, though I might be ready to compromise and have threading down to depth 1, with the understanding that it should be used for brief local replies only.</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section id="where-to-start" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="where-to-start">Where to start?</h3>
<p>Polymath started and happened to a large part on blogs. Looking for a place where I could start thinking about these questions I settled on <a href="https://github.com/polyclimate/">GitHub</a> and set up the blog you are reading now using <a href="https://quarto.org/">Quarto</a>. The latter enables inclusion of mathematical citation, code execution and citations. Comments are enabled in the blog using GitHub’s discussion feature through <a href="https://github.com/giscus/giscus/">Giscus</a>. Next to code hosting GitHub also offers Wikis, project management, issue tracking, and automated code pipelines, which means pretty much all potential ingredients for such collaborative work are there. Further, quite a few of the people I could imagine contributing to such efforts are already actively doing science in the open on GitHub, so if you have an account there you are ready to comment and contribute.</p>
<p>For any work done in public there are concerns about trolls, here GitHub has features for limiting interaction. As on most social platforms there can be difficulties for people from countries under <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls">trade control regulations</a>, but for the usage of the free GitHub tools there should be no impediment in contributing. GitHub is a social platform, so it might be possible to recreate some of the fruitful collaboration which used to happen on sites like Twitter, where tagging the user account of a person knowledgeable on a niche topic could get them into a conversation and generate new insights.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://manubot.org/">Manubot</a> there is also a successful usage of GitHub as platform for collaborative science, developed during writing the Deep Review, a review article on deep learning in precision medicine <span class="citation" data-cites="Ching_2018_gddkhn Himmelstein_2019_c7np">(Ching et al. 2018; Himmelstein et al. 2019)</span>.</p>
<p>Challenges in online collaboration are of course partly technical, but I believe mostly social. Working in the open has benefits, but can also create new opportunities.</p>
<p>On the challenges with the research questions stated above, is it lack of funding for updates, which are just updates and not novel, shiny discoveries? Does the current academic system with its many short-term contracts disincentivize such work?</p>
<p>What questions in general could or should be approached in such a collaborative manner?</p>
<p>Leave your thoughts and ideas in the comments. (Sign up on GitHub if you haven’t already.)</p>
